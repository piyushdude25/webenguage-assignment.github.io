Task-2 >>

Subject: Request for Extension of Delivery Date.

Dear Team Member,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you that due to a family emergency, I will not be able to meet the original due date.

As you are aware, the expected delivery date for the task was tomorrow, however, due to unforeseen circumstances, I will not be able to complete the task by that date.

I would like to request an extension of three days to complete the task. Please let me know if this extension is possible and if there are any additional steps that I need to take. I would be happy to provide any additional information or answer any questions you may have.

Thank you for your understanding and support in this matter.

Best regards,
